# HCV-App
This repository contains the resources for the capstone project within Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. 

In this project, MSPPM and MISM students worked together with Homewood Children’s Village (HCV) to create key components of a smartphone app that can help match interested HCV-supported students with appropriate experiences, internships, and mentorships that can help connect them to 21st-century career opportunities.
