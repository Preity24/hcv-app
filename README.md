# Backend Server Settings

Reference: [link](https://mfikri.com/en/blog/node-express-react-mysql)

First you need to enter the server folder and run

```
nodemon index
```

This will start the server and then you can direct to http://localhost:5001/ to visit server.

For now we have four routers:

```
	http://localhost:5001/   Get all opportunities
	http://localhost:5001/:id   Get opportunities based on their id
	http://localhost:5001/opportunities/  Insert one opportunity(You need to use Postman to set the data into request body)
	http://localhost:5001/opportunities/:id  Update the opportunity based on their id(You need to use Postman to set the data into request body)
```

You could use postman to test these routers, but before that you should have your database ready on your local machine.

# Database Settings

Checked sql_scripts folder and find create_table_scripts.sql. It's script for you to create the table and insert some demo data.

You may need to grant permission to the database user and you may use this script:

```mysql
CREATE USER 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, PROCESS, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE USER, EVENT, TRIGGER ON *.* TO 'admin'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
