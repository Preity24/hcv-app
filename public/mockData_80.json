Students will get hands-on experience using engineering software to design products and then fabricate them in a CMU makerspace. Students will also learn about different engineering disciplines through daily presentations and tours of CMU engineering labs. The CMU Engineering Workshop offers hands-on experiences to high school students in the realm of mechanical engineering with a focus on Design and Manufacturing. In their projects, students will come up with their own product designs and then will learn how to render their designs for fabrication through engineering sketches and Computer-Aided Design (CAD). They will be taught how to evaluate a design with Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), and they will fabricate their products utilizing laser cutters, 3D printers, and hand-held tools. Students will complete three to five unique projects during the week and will, of course, get to take their work home.",

Approximately 30 fourth-grade students from various Pittsburgh area schools are invited to visit Carnegie Mellon’s campus and participate in a full day of engineering activities. This program provides the students with an interactive introduction to the exciting world of engineering and exposes them to fun and educational, hands-on activities geared toward their age and ability level. Through various experiments and exercises, students learn how engineering plays a part in many of the ordinary things they see every day. Moving 4th aims to inspire young students to seek out future studies in math, science, and engineering. This early exposure to the world of engineering aims to excite young students about science and math and to make them more likely to pursue technical courses throughout their education. Many times, this program serves as an introduction to these concepts and enlightens children who may not have otherwise sought out such educational opportunities. It is important that the university shares its educational resources with the local community, to support and foster the education of young students who may otherwise see the institution as a place that only serves economically advantaged populations.",

We want them to look at everyday items from sporting equipment to food to electronics to furniture and beyond and ask themselves: What problem does this solve? Who has the problem? Why is it important to solve the problem? What types of engineering were used to solve the problem? The event includes a presentation that introduces them to various engineering disciplines through recognizable examples, as well as a series of exhibits for the students to visit where they can interact with CMU engineering students to learn more about the objects on display and the engineering concepts that go into them.",

At the end of the program, you will be able to answer a variety of question on mitigation, adaptation, and dealing with unexpected impacts, such as: What is climate change? What is the role of engineering to solve the climate change challenge? How does a power plant work? Where & how is your electricity generated? How much do we consume, and how does this relate to electricity? What new building designs can be done? What can and can’t you do to mitigate the impacts of climate change? Why is policy needed? Society has to make a decision, and how do you go about it? What careers could you have in climate, energy, or the environment? The program includes a variety of experiments, field trips and activities organized by PhD students from Carnegie Mellon University’s department of Engineering & Public Policy.",

            "description": "The Architecture Explorations program encourages Pittsburgh youth to look closely at their built environment, be open to creative expression, ask questions, think critically, and understand civic responsibility - all through the lens of architecture. Architecture Explorations is a collection of architecture-based extracurricular and academic enrichment programs for students in kindergarten through high school, offered through Carnegie Mellon's School of Architecture. Our organization partners with several Pittsburgh communities, schools, and museums to provide an array of architecture education programs. Whether you are a student, parent, counselor, teacher, or community organization, we would love to hear from you and help devise a plan to provide a program that is tailored for each appropriate age-group and organization. During the summer, the CAE partners with fellow arts organizations to offer a variety of summer day camps. Join us at the Carnegie Museum of Art, where the museum becomes a classroom and work from the museum’s permanent collection inspires architectural projects; at Assemble, to engage with art and technology through making; on the CMU campus for a variety of special-topic courses; and at one of the many ALN Partners throughout the region.",

Tailored towards middle school and ninth grade students, these programs are geared to ease the transition between middle school and high school. AG facilitates two formats of non-professionalized artistic engagements with students: Classroom Studios and School's Out Studios. Using a common foundation of creative writing, each workshop connects students to other fields of creativity, introducing students to different paths the humanities can lead them to in the visual, performative, and digital arts. Curriculum is designed using the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for the Arts and Humanities, criteria from the Allegheny Partners for Out-of-School Time Quality Campaign, and a culturally responsive pedagogy promoting arts and humanities education as a social practice. These workshops emphasize the humanistic, historical and cultural roots of various mediums in order to prepare students to be well-rounded, well-prepared, and self-aware future artists, professionals, and citizens.",

In the past, students have started and managed a Minecraft server business; designed and created robotic hands; built a working hologram projector; and recorded tracks in the style of musique concrète.

But if you don't see your favorite topic among the ones listed, don't fret: students are encouraged to propose their own project ideas and to take full advantage of our project advisors' collective knowledge and expertise High school students meet with their project advisors for a weekly 3 hour workshop over a 10 week period during the spring semester (the 2020-2021 semester has a different remote-only structure). The majority of project work is done during these workshops, though students continue to work on the project throughout the week.  At the end of the 10 weeks program, the high school students present their projects to friends, family, and the Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh communities in a project showcase.",
