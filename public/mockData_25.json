Students will get hands-on experience using engineering software to design products and then fabricate them in a CMU makerspace. Students will also learn about different engineering disciplines through daily presentations and tours of CMU engineering labs. The CMU Engineering Workshop offers hands-on experiences to high school students in the realm of mechanical engineering with a focus on Design and Manufacturing. In their projects, students will come up with their own product designs and then will learn how to render their designs for fabrication through engineering sketches and Computer-Aided Design (CAD). They will be taught how to evaluate a design with Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), and they will fabricate their products utilizing laser cutters, 3D printers, and hand-held tools. Students will complete three to five unique projects during the week and will, of course, get to take their work home.",

Approximately 30 fourth-grade students from various Pittsburgh area schools are invited to visit Carnegie Mellon’s campus and participate in a full day of engineering activities. This program provides the students with an interactive introduction to the exciting world of engineering and exposes them to fun and educational, hands-on activities geared toward their age and ability level. Through various experiments and exercises, students learn how engineering plays a part in many of the ordinary things they see every day. Moving 4th aims to inspire young students to seek out future studies in math, science, and engineering. This early exposure to the world of engineering aims to excite young students about science and math and to make them more likely to pursue technical courses throughout their education. Many times, this program serves as an introduction to these concepts and enlightens children who may not have otherwise sought out such educational opportunities. It is important that the university shares its educational resources with the local community, to support and foster the education of young students who may otherwise see the institution as a place that only serves economically advantaged populations.",

We want them to look at everyday items from sporting equipment to food to electronics to furniture and beyond and ask themselves: What problem does this solve? Who has the problem? Why is it important to solve the problem? What types of engineering were used to solve the problem? The event includes a presentation that introduces them to various engineering disciplines through recognizable examples, as well as a series of exhibits for the students to visit where they can interact with CMU engineering students to learn more about the objects on display and the engineering concepts that go into them.",

At the end of the program, you will be able to answer a variety of question on mitigation, adaptation, and dealing with unexpected impacts, such as: What is climate change? What is the role of engineering to solve the climate change challenge? How does a power plant work? Where & how is your electricity generated? How much do we consume, and how does this relate to electricity? What new building designs can be done? What can and can’t you do to mitigate the impacts of climate change? Why is policy needed? Society has to make a decision, and how do you go about it? What careers could you have in climate, energy, or the environment? The program includes a variety of experiments, field trips and activities organized by PhD students from Carnegie Mellon University’s department of Engineering & Public Policy.",
