Through various experiments and exercises, students learn how engineering plays a part in many of the ordinary things they see every day.

Moving 4th aims to inspire young students to seek out future studies in math, science, and engineering. This early exposure to the world of engineering aims to excite young students about science and math and to make them more likely to pursue technical courses throughout their education. Many times, this program serves as an introduction to these concepts and enlightens children who may not have otherwise sought out such educational opportunities.
